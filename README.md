# GutFungiProfiling
the goal of the project is to elaborate and define a method or approach to characterize the fungal part of the gut microbiota

4 objectives distributed in two approaches:
  - Approach 1: Read based profiling
      - objective 1: give a workflow/pipeline to obtain qualitative an quantitative information about fungi composition from metagenomes obtained in fecal samples, with these metagenomes, and database, obtain these informations
      - objective 2: build a database from public sources

  - Approach 2: addition of a Co-Assembling strategy
      - objective 1: give a specific database builded from the project metagenomes to enrich the read based profiling, evaluate if this enrichment is impacting or not
      - objective 2: give the workflow/pipeline to build the specific database from the project metagenomes
   


whe have around 100M reads per sample,
